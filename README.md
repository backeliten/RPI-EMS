# RPI-EMS

Idea to use a Raspberry Pi and Xenomai to be able to control a Gasoline Engine. Both Spark and fuel.

Due to much little time for this project, I will upload the basic structure for the system to maybe be helpful for some other, 
or if someone else is interested in continue this project.
